        <h3>The Nightsisters</h3>
        <p>
            The Nightsisters, also known as the Witches of Dathomir, were a clan and order of magick-wielding females who lived on
            Dathomir, a planet bathed in dark energies. These Dark side users were able to perform their arcane magicks by tapping
            into the magical ichor that flowed from the depths of their planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to a commonly told story, the first Nightsisters were trained in the ways of the Force by Allya, a female Jedi
            whom the Jedi Council had sent into exile on the mysterious planet of Dathomir. However, the Jedi Council had no records
            of an exile named Allya, and the Nightsisters themselves had other, contradicting tales about their origins.[5]
            
            Though a weapon used more commonly by Jedi, the Nightsisters had adopted lightwhips by the High Republic Era.[9]
            
            Since their power was at its most potent on their home planet, the Nightsisters rarely ventured off-world during the
            height of the Galactic Republic. However, this changed when a sister named Talzin became the clan's Mother. During this
            time, Talzin worked alongside the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, who ultimately betrayed Talzin and took her son Maul from
            her.[10] At the time of the Clone Wars, Talzin began to sell her sisters' services as mercenaries to the galaxy's
            wealthy citizens.[11]
            
            
            At some point in the years leading up to the Clone Wars, the clan was forced to give up the young Asajj Ventress to the
            Siniteen criminal Hal'Sted as insurance for protection.[6]
        </p>

        <p>
            Ventress later returned to her people after being betrayed by Count Dooku, seeking their help for revenge against her
            former master.[6] After the failure of their first attempt, the Nightsisters used the Nightbrother, Savage Opress, as an
            instrument to destroy Dooku.They used their magic to increase his size, rage, and power.[12] However, their scheme would
            earn them the ire of Dooku, who would later dispatch General Grievous to Dathomir in retaliation. The Nightsisters were
            utterly destroyed and massacred with their fortress left in ruins during the battle, with Ventress, Talzin,[2]
            Merrin,[13] and Shelish being the few survivors.[7]
            
            While Ventress pursued a path as a bounty hunter,[14] Mother Talzin continued to live in seclusion in the Nightsisters'
            ruined fortress, where she helped heal the broken body and mind of her son, Darth Maul.[15] She orchestrated the
            kidnapping of Bardottan Queen Julia to make her more powerful than the Jedi and the Sith. However, she failed when Jedi
            Master Mace Windu and Representative Jar Jar Binks foiled her plans and she disappeared.[16] Maul and Talzin conspired
            to eliminate Darth Sidious and Dooku, but Talzin was killed in the eventual confrontation.[17] Meanwhile, Ventress
            joined Quinlan Vos in one final assassination attempt against Dooku, but was killed by the Count while protecting Vos,
            her newfound lover.[18]
        </p>

        <h3>The Nightbrother</h3>
        <img src="Nightbrothers_SWCT.png" href="" alt="Logo" style="width: 200px;">
        <p>
            The Nightbrothers were a small colony of Dathomirian Zabrak males who lived in a village on the far side of the planet
            Dathomir under the rule of the Nightsisters. After the destruction of their other village, they lived in another
            village. They lived in subservience to the Nightsisters' matriarch Mother Talzin until the witches' near-extinction
            during the Clone Wars. The infamous Maul, former apprentice to the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, was born a
            Nightbrother, as was his brother and later apprentice Savage Opress.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Nightsister Talzin was the mother of Maul. At some point before the Battle of Naboo, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious
            took Maul from Talzin, his brothers, and his village to be his apprentice.[6]
            
            During the Clone Wars, Nightsister and Count Dooku's former assassin, Asajj Ventress, came to the village to choose one
            of the heads of the tribe to serve her. Ventress then arranged for three tests to see their potential. During the third
            and final test, Ventress fought Savage Opress and his brother Feral. After Feral was defeated, Savage continued to fight
            Ventress but lost to her becoming her servant. Following the Devaron massacre,[1] the Nightbrothers fought Jedi Knights
            Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, but yielded when Skywalker subdued Brother Viscus. Viscus then told them that
            Opress had been taken by one of Talzin's Nightsisters as a mate. As the Jedi left, Viscus ordered the Nightbrothers to
            let them go.[7]
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike their female counterparts, the Nightbrothers were spared the wrath of the Separatists during the Battle of
            Dathomir. They were sent by Talzin to Maul's aid in her stead when he requested her help. Viscus and his fellow Zabraks
            engaged Dooku in combat on Ord Mantell, but were swiftly defeated by the Sith Lord. Dooku would then be captured by the
            Shadow Collective before he had the chance to kill Viscus.[5] Later, after Dooku feigned allegiance to Maul, the latter
            brought him to the Nightbrother village on Dathomir where Viscus awaited, and Viscus escorted them to the heart of
            Mother Talzin's power where the Great Mother possessed Dooku's body to drain his energy. Viscus and the Nightbrothers
            then left to prepare Talzin's chambers. Soon thereafter the village was attacked by the Confederacy and Talzin was
            killed after sending Maul to safety. Despite the loss of the Mother and subsequent destruction of their village at the
            hands of the Separatists,[8] the Nightbrother clan remained active on Dathomir under the leadership of Viscus.[2
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the end of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Taron Malicos was stranded on Dathomir. Embracing the dark side,
            Malicos killed Brother Viscus and several Nightbrothers, taking their horns as trophies and becoming their new leader.
            The surviving Nightsister Merrin was then manipulated against the Jedi by Malicos and the two took control of the
            Nightbrothers by 14 BBY. By this point the Nightbrothers lived in a village in the Dathomir wilds. There, the
            Nightbrothers started domesticating bane back spiders. When Cal Kestis came to the planet during his secret mission to
            rebuild the Jedi Order, Merrin threatened him and left her magically-enhanced brothers to face him. Kestis took down his
            attackers and survived. Kestis and Merrin would later team up to defeat Malicos in a duel and the pair departed from
            Dathomir, leaving the Nightbrothers behind.[2]
            
            The Nardithi Nightsister Jerserra, another survivor of Grievous' massacre, had several Nightbrothers. including Freff,
            who served her.[9]
            
            Maul later returned to establish a powerbase on his homeworld, where he ruled the Crimson Dawn criminal organization
            from the shadows.[10] Shortly before the Galactic Civil War, Maul stated he was the last survivor of the Nightsisters'
            civilization.[4] He later met his end at the hands of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine.[11]
