        <h3>Battlefront (2004)</h3>
        <p>
            Star Wars: Battlefront is a first and third-person shooter video game based on the Star Wars film franchise. Developed
            by Pandemic Studios and published by LucasArts, it is the first game in the Star Wars: Battlefront series. It was
            released on September 21, 2004, for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows to coincide the release of the Star Wars
            Trilogy DVD set. It is also available for purchase on both the Xbox 360 and Xbox One through their backwards
            compatibility features. Aspyr released a Macintosh port in July 2005, and a cellular phone version, Star Wars
            Battlefront Mobile, was released November 1, 2005. A sequel, Star Wars: Battlefront II, was released on November 1,
            2005, for Windows, Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. The game is primarily played as a conquest game,
            however other modes such as Galactic Conquest bring strategy elements to the title.
            
            Battlefront features several locales from major Star Wars battles, and includes voice acting from veteran voice actors
            Temuera Morrison, Tom Kane, and Nick Jameson. It received generally favorable reviews from critics, averaging
            approximately an 80% approval rating across all platforms at aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic. Critics
            praised the multiplayer component and the ability to play a part in major Star Wars battles, however the lacking single
            player component and poor AI were points of concern.
        </p>
        <p>
            Star Wars: Battlefront encompasses battles between four main factions from both the original and prequel trilogies: the
            Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) from the prequel era, and the Rebel Alliance and
            Galactic Empire from the original trilogy. In each faction, five different classes of character become available. Four
            main classes are similar for each faction, infantry, heavy weapons, pilot and sniper, while the fifth is unique. Each
            faction also has a non-playable hero character that participates in battle for a limited amount of time: Count Dooku
            (CIS), Mace Windu (Republic), Luke Skywalker (Rebels), and Darth Vader (Empire).[2]
            
            Gameplay in Battlefront is conquest-based. Each faction has a finite amount of reinforcements, and each is given control
            of a set number of command posts in a given level.[3] The object is to either eliminate enemy forces or capture and hold
            all command posts simultaneously for 20 seconds. Several ground and air vehicles are available on the battlefield. These
            range from the hulking AT-AT to the fast speeder bike and vary based on the level. There are more than 25 vehicles
            in-game. Some larger vehicles also function as mobile command posts, which cannot be captured, but are lost if the
            vehicle is destroyed. In addition, some maps have indigenous forces. These can be neutral to both factions, such as
            Jawas, hostile to one faction, such as Wookies, or hostile to both factions, such as Tusken Raiders. Command posts
            belonging to hostile natives can also be captured to minimize their presence.[2]
            
            The Microsoft Windows and Macintosh versions of Star Wars: Battlefront can be played online with up to 64 players via
            local area network (LAN) or over the internet via GameSpy.[4] The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions can accommodate up to
            32 players or can be played in split screen mode with two players. The PlayStation 2 version utilizes specialized
            GameSpy servers, while the Xbox utilized Microsoft's Xbox Live network.[4] Xbox online play is no longer available as
            the original Xbox Live servers were shut down on April 15, 2010.

        </p>

        <p>
            While the game is played similarly in every mode, each is a unique scenario which utilizes mode-specific features to
            further extend gameplay. Three modes are presented to the player: Campaign, which serves as the game's story mode,
            Galactic Conquest, in which the player must conquer planets, and Instant Action, which allows the player to select the
            battle they wish to play and adjust settings such as reinforcements to their liking.[4]
            
            Campaign groups several battles together in a set order loosely based on the historical campaign of either the Clone
            Wars or the Galactic Civil War. As Episode III had not been released at the time, the Clone Wars campaign ends with the
            Battle of Kashyyyk. Footage from the five films then released are used as cutscenes between battles.[6] The player
            starts the campaign as either a member of the Separatist army or an Imperial Stormtrooper. Around halfway through the
            chosen campaign the perspective switches to the Clone Troopers or Rebels. To maintain continuity, missions prior to the
            battle of Geonosis pit the Separatists against native forces only, and for the first two missions the super battle droid
            is unavailable, replaced with a standard battle droid.[6]
            
            In Galactic Conquest, the player uses strategy to take control of planets and dominate an area of the galaxy. First the
            player chooses a map configuration based on conflicts from both eras of Star Wars history.[3] Some maps start both sides
            evenly while others favor one faction. Next, the player chooses which faction to play as. The game is played in turns,
            with the player starting first. The player can select an enemy-controlled or neutral planet to attack. After selecting
            what planet to attack, the player is able to activate a bonus from one of his already owned planets (if any). Each
            planet provides its own unique bonus, but must be captured before the player can use it. Bonuses help the player in
            battle by impeding the enemy or assisting the player's team. If one side manages to win four battles (not necessarily in
            a row), they gain access to their faction's Secret Base bonus. Secret Base bonuses are very powerful and can change the
            course of a game. They can be used on any enemy planet, except for the enemy's Secret Base. The game is completed when
            one faction controls all planets on the map.[2]
            
            Instant Action mode allows the players to jump right into a battle of their choice.[6] The player can also customize a
            list of battles, which then can be played through in the order they have chosen, or in a random order. Players can
            choose between playing as the Republic, the CIS, the Empire, or the Rebels on each of the maps, except Kamino, Geonosis,
            Endor and Hoth, which do not allow the player to select their battle era, as these follow their canonical settings.
            Players can also choose whether or not they would like to have heroes fight for each side.[6]

        <h3>Battlefront II (2005)</h3>

        <p>
            Star Wars: Battlefront II is a first-person shooter and third-person shooter video game based on the Star Wars film
            franchise. Developed by Pandemic Studios and published by LucasArts, it is a sequel to 2004's Star Wars: Battlefront and
            the second game in the Star Wars: Battlefront series. The game was released in PAL regions on October 31, 2005, on the
            PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable (PSP), Microsoft Windows, and Xbox platforms, and in North America on November 1 of
            the same year. It was released on the PlayStation Store on October 20, 2009, for download on the PSP. The PSP version
            was developed by Savage Entertainment.
            
            The game features new vehicles, characters, game mechanics, maps, and missions compared to the original Battlefront.
            Unlike its predecessor, Battlefront II features a more narrative-based campaign, retelling portions of the Star Wars
            story from the point of view of a veteran Imperial Stormtrooper, reminiscing about his tour of duty in service of both
            the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire. Gameplay additions over Battlefront include the use of Jedi and Sith,
            additional game modes such as hero assault, and objective-based space battles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Battlefront II was well received, with the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions scoring in the mid 80s at aggregators
            GameRankings and Metacritic. The PC version scored slightly lower at both sites, scoring a 76.60% at GameRankings and 78
            at Metacritic. The PSP version was the worst received, scoring 70.93% at GameRankings and 69 at Metacritic. Reviewers
            generally praised the narrative-based story; however, some felt that the upgrades from the original were not enough to
            merit the price. Like the original game, it was a commercial success.
            
            GameSpy Technology scheduled a shut-down across all titles using the service for May 31, 2014, which included Star Wars:
            Battlefront II for PC, PS2, and Xbox.[1] Electronic Arts announced it would extend support for Battlefront II until June
            30, 2014.[2] The extended support ended on July 25, 2014, taking all GameSpy online video games across all platforms
            offline. The Windows version was added to a list of supported games on GameRanger on May 31, 2014, which allows for
            continued online play.[3] On October 2, 2017, multiplayer for the Windows version was again enabled, allowing for Steam
            and GOG cross-play.[4][5][6] As of April 26, 2018, Battlefront II is now backwards compatible on the Xbox One and has
            enhanced graphics for the Xbox One X. The DLC that originally came out exclusively for the original Xbox version of the
            game was released for the Xbox One version in June 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
            Battlefront II is fundamentally similar to its predecessor, albeit with the addition of new gameplay mechanics, such as
            the ability to sprint and roll forward.[7] The general objective in most missions is to eliminate the enemy faction,
            although there are game modes with a different objective, such as a capture the flag mode. Like its predecessor Star
            Wars Battlefront, the game is split into two eras: the Clone Wars, with battles taking place between the Galactic
            Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and the Galactic Civil War, where battles between the Rebel
            Alliance and Galactic Empire take place. Players have the ability to choose between six classes during gameplay. Four
            class types are common to all factions: Infantry, Heavy, Sniper and Engineer.[8] In addition to the four standard
            classes, every faction has two special classes, which are exclusive to each faction and are unlocked by scoring a
            predetermined number of points; there is a limited number of special classes that can be on the battlefield at the same
            time. The special classes are the Commander and the Jet Trooper for the Republic; the MagnaGuard and the Droideka for
            the CIS; the Bothan Spy and the Wookiee for the Rebels; and the Officer and the Dark Trooper for the Empire.[9]
            
            Battlefront II introduces a new special class—Heroes—that allows players to control iconic characters from the Star Wars
            universe; heroes were featured in the original Battlefront, but only as NPCs that spawned randomly during battles.
            Heroes are also unlocked by scoring a predetermined number of points, and are unique for every faction. Heroes serve as
            the most powerful class in the game and, as such, there can be a maximum of one hero for each faction on the battlefield
            at the same time. Each hero is available only on certain maps, although there is a team deathmatch mode, exclusive to
            the Mos Eisley map, that allows all heroes from all factions to compete against each other to earn points by performing
            kills.

        <h3>Battlefron (2015)</h3>
        <p>
            Star Wars Battlefront is an action shooter video game developed by EA DICE, with additional work from Criterion
            Games,[5] and published by Electronic Arts in November 2015. The game, based on the Star Wars film franchise, is the
            third major release in the Star Wars: Battlefront sub-series, and is considered a reboot to the previous games, instead
            of a sequel,[6] to reflect the new Star Wars canon that Lucasfilm established (to replace the Star Wars expanded
            universe) after being acquired by The Walt Disney Company. The game received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who
            praised its gameplay, visuals, musical scores, technical aspects and high production values, but criticized its lack of
            content in both single and multiplayer modes. More than 14 million copies have been shipped. A sequel, Star Wars
            Battlefront II, was released on November 17, 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
            Star Wars Battlefront is an action game played from either a first-person or third-person view; players can switch views
            whenever desired, similar to previous games, except when controlling "hero" characters or their personal guards.[7]
            Players traverse planets from the original Star Wars trilogy, such as Endor, Hoth, Tatooine, Bespin, and Sullust, as
            well as the planet of Jakku introduced in the sequel trilogy. To navigate the game's various maps, players use a variety
            of vehicles, including both air and land-based vehicles, such as speeder bikes and AT-STs, which can be unlocked during
            every match by finding tokens that spawn randomly across the map.[8] Battles are planet-based, restricting players from
            exploring space. The only maps that are space-based were added through DLC, namely in the "Death Star" pack (released in
            September 2016), which included the titular Death Star, and the "Rogue One" pack (released in December 2016 and based on
            the movie of the same name), which included Scarif. The game's weapons, characters, gear, and abilities are
            customizable.[9] As new weapons are unlocked, players have the ability to share them with their teammates.[8]
            Battlefront does not feature iron sights apart from one blaster, but allows players to zoom in for better accuracy.[10]
            
            The game lets players choose whether to control a Rebel Alliance soldier or an Imperial Stormtrooper. Players can also
            assume the role of iconic characters from the Star Wars films, which serve as "heroes" and, similarly to vehicles, are
            unlocked during every match by finding specific tokens across the map. At launch, the hero roster included Luke
            Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Emperor Palpatine, Leia Organa, and Boba Fett, with Nien Nunb, Greedo, Lando
            Calrissian, Dengar, Bossk, Chewbacca, Jyn Erso, and Orson Krennic being added later through DLC.[11][12] Non-playable
            characters such as C-3PO, Admiral Ackbar, and Jabba the Hutt also make minor appearances in the game.[13] The game
            includes cooperative missions, which can be played offline, but excludes a campaign mode. Players can complete the
            missions both independently and with bots or another player; the game supports split screen on consoles.[14] The game's
            online multiplayer mode supports up to 40 players in one match and consists of 16 multiplayer maps. These maps feature
            five locations from the Star Wars universe: Hoth, Tatooine, Endor, Sullust, and Jakku, with three more locations added
            through different DLCs: Cloud City on Bespin, the Death Star, and Scarif.[15][16]
        </p>

        <H3>Battlefront II (2017)</H3>
        <p>
            Star Wars Battlefront II is a 2017 action shooter video game based on the Star Wars franchise. It is the fourth main
            installment of the Star Wars: Battlefront series, and a sequel to the 2015 reboot of the series. It was developed by EA
            DICE, in collaboration with Criterion Games and Motive Studios, and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released
            worldwide on November 17, 2017 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. It features both single-player
            and multiplayer game modes, including a story-driven campaign, set in between the films Return of the Jedi and The Force
            Awakens, which depicts the climax of the Galactic Civil War and the Galactic Empire's downfall from the perspective of
            Imperial commander-turned-New Republic soldier Iden Versio.
            
            Upon release, Battlefront II received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the multiplayer, gameplay, balancing,
            visuals, and variety, but criticism for its single-player modes, campaign, microtransactions and progression system. The
            game was also subject to widespread criticism regarding the status of its loot boxes, which could give players
            substantial gameplay advantages if purchased with real money. A response from EA's community team on Reddit on the topic
            became the single most down-voted comment in the site's history, amassing over 600 thousand down-votes.[2] In response,
            EA decided to temporarily remove microtransactions from the game until a later date.
            
            Since its release, the game received numerous content additions through free title updates in an attempt to repair its
            reputation after launch, which brought in a large number of new players. These updates ended on April 29, 2020, after
            Electronic Arts concluded that the game had reached its desired number of players and had substantially improved since
            the initial release.[3] A Celebration Edition of the game, which includes all cosmetic options, was released on 5
            December 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
            Star Wars Battlefront II is a third and first-person shooter, featuring both single-player and multiplayer game modes.
            Gameplay is split in two main categories: ground battles and space battles. Both occur across three eras: the Clone
            Wars, with battles taking place between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems; the Galactic
            Civil War, where battles between the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire take place; and the war between the Resistance
            and the First Order. Each faction has its own unique type of soldiers that players control, such as clone troopers for
            the Republic, battle droids for the CIS, and stormtroopers for the Empire and the First Order; however, they all control
            identically. Every faction also has specific starfighters, which, unlike soldiers, play differently from one another.[4]
            
            Battles take place across a variety of maps, and every era has its own exclusive maps. At launch, the game featured a

            Star Wars Battlefront II received "mixed or average" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[40][38][39]
            Metacritic user reviews for the PlayStation 4 version reached a low rating of 0.8/10, labeled as "overwhelming dislike",
            due to the controversies (see below) and review bombing.[52]
            
            In his 4/5 star review for GamesRadar+, Andy Hartup praised the multiplayer but criticized the single player modes,
            saying the game has a "very strong multiplayer offering tarnished by overly complicated character progression, and a
            lavish, beautiful story campaign lacking in substance or subtlety."[46] Game Revolution felt the campaign started strong
            but weakened as it progressed, praising the multiplayer gameplay while criticizing the microtransactions, loot box
            progression system, and locking of heroes.[45]
            
            For EGM's review, Nick Plessas praised the multiplayer combat, balancing, and variety, but criticized the game's
            sustained focus around loot crates.[43] Andrew Reiner of Game Informer gave the game 6.5/10, writing "Answering the call
            for more content, Star Wars Battlefront II offers a full campaign and more than enough multiplayer material, but the
            entire experience is brought down by microtransactions."[44] IGN's Tom Marks also gave the game 6.5/10, saying "Star
            Wars Battlefront 2 has great feeling blasters, but its progression system makes firing them an unsatisfying grind."[49]
            
            The game was nominated for "Best Shooter", "Best Graphics" and "Best Multiplayer" in IGN's Best of 2017
            Awards,[53][54][55] and was a runner-up for "Most Disappointing Game" in Giant Bomb's 2017 Game of the Year Awards.[56]
            In Game Informer's Reader's Choice Best of 2017 Awards, fewer readers voted for the game for "Best Co-Op
            Multiplayer".[57] The website also awarded the game for "Best Graphics", "Best Audio" and "Biggest Disappointment" in
            their 2017 Shooter of the Year Awards.[58] Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw of Zero Punctuation ranked the game at No. 1 on his
            list of the Five Blandest Games of 2017.[59]
            
            Sales
            In the U.S., Star Wars Battlefront II was the second best-selling title in November, behind Call of Duty: WWII.[60]
            Within its first week on sale in Japan, the PlayStation 4 version sold 38,769 copies, placing it at number four on the
            all format sales chart.[61] By December 2017, the game had sold 9 million copies worldwide. In January 2018, EA
            announced that the game missed their sales target as they had hoped to sell 10 million copies in that time, and blamed
            the loot crate controversy.[62]
